# StarWars-Movie-CMD
## General Info
This script will play a Starwars movie in Command Prompt. It is a really neat thing that is a built in feature of windows!

## Note
This will only work on Windows computers like all of my other scripts. This script requires an add-on to be enabled in the windows settings. This script assumes that the add-on is off. The add-on is "telnet" and for all Windows computers except XP and 98 it is off by default and there is little reason for someone to have turned it on but, if their telnet is on already than this would just turn it off and cause the script not to work. This script needs to enable an add-on which when enabled can take a while to load. I knew this when making the script and put in a 20 second delay for this to load but, if that is not enough time for it load on the target system, then this script will try and continue without the needed add-on and fail. I think 20 seconds is enough time but some systems are slower than others. Basically there is a lot of if's with this script. The script will work with the way my system is configured but it might be different system to system based on settings and harware. Maybe at some point i'll try and make this script work better with more systems but this is what you get for right now

## This script was tested
It should work but there are a lot of "If's" with this script so if anything that I mentioned in the "Note" area happends than it will not work.
