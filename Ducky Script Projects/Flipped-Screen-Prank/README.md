# Flipped-Screen-Prank 
## General Info
This is a Ducky Script program that once plugged into it's target system will go into settings and put the target system in "flipped" landscape mode. This can be really annoying as not only is everything upside-down but your mouse is also flipped so all of it's actions are reversed. This will not caused any harm to the target system as it is just meant to be a prank but you should still be careful when using it and only use it on systems you own / have permission to use in this way. 

## NOTE
This will only work on Windows computers. I'm sure you could make a version for MacOS and Linux but this script will only work with Windows and nothing else. If you would like to make a MacOS or Linux version go right ahead but you will have to vastly change the script for it to work on those OS's

## This has been tested
It took a few tries but it works perfectly now. I would recommend you test it once before using it for real but it should be all good.
