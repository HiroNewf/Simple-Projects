# DuckyScript-Wallpaper-Prank 
## General Information
A simple wallpaper prank made using the Ducky Script coding language. This is a very basic and simple script but still should be used carefully. It will not cause any harm to the target system but can be rather annoying so please only use this on systems you own / have permission to use in this way.  

## NOTE
This will only work on Windows computers as many of the keyboard shortcuts and programs used are only on Windows computers. This could be modified to work for Linux and MacOS and I might do so in the future but, for right now, this will only work with Windows OS systems. 

## This is tested
It took a few attempted but it is tested with a Rubber Ducky and it WILL work. I would still recommend you test it yourself before trying to use it for real but, either way it should work perfectly.
