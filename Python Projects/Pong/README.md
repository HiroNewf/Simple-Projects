# Pong
A fully working version of the class game Pong. You can download this and run it in any coder/text editor and supports python programs such as Pycharm or Visual Studio Code, you could also just copy and past the code if you don't feel like downloading the files for whatever reason. I might add sound design to the game at some point as well as mess around the asthenic. Right now it is just classic looking Pong with the black and white, but some color wouldn't be the worst thing. I might make multiple versions of the game each with their own color theme or something. Also, I made this using a tutorial linked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGf2GcyHPhc) if you wanna check it out and learn how to code this for yourself! (It's the first game that is taught in this video, I wouldn't recommend the other ones as they aren't great tutorials)
