Probably gonna to ditch this code and go a different approach. Script_1 is not finished and probably will never be. I will be adding Script_2 sometime soon and I plan on finishing it. 

Script_2 (aka the actually working one) was made using tutorials from ToytyoEdTech. first video in series is linked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP7KMlbvtOo) if you wanna check it out.
